⚡️ Usage based metering & billing for developers ⚡️

Build usage-based, credit-based, or hybrid pricing models with full control. Flexprice handles metering, pricing, and invoicing so you can focus on building, not billing.

## Open architecture
The Flexprice core (metering, credits, pricing, billing) has an open and composable design. 

<p align="center">
  <img align="center" src="./assets/open-arch.jpg" alt="open architechture"/>
</p>

Your application, whether it's running backend APIs, AI agents, or custom workflows, can send usage data to Flexprice. You can directly stream data from data warehouses or analytics pipelines as well.

At the core, Flexprice processes this data in real time. We handle everything that usually ends up as custom logic built by developers. Our platform calculates pricing based on the customer’s plan, applies any prepaid or promotional credits, enforces feature limits, and generates accurate invoices automatically. Whether you're using seat-based subscriptions, usage-based pricing, or prepaid credit bundles, you can set up and iterate on your pricing model without writing billing infrastructure from scratch.

After billing is computed, our platform connects to your existing tools for payments, CPQ, CRM, and accounting, ensuring billing information flows into the systems your business already uses. It can sync invoices to your payment processor, update customer data in your CRM, and push revenue numbers to your accounting tools.

With this architecture, you get full control over how billing works inside your product, while saving your team from the complexity of maintaining it all.

## 🔧 Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Features

1. Create a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/new-feature
```

2. Create component structure:

```bash
mkdir -p src/components/organisms/NewFeature
touch src/components/organisms/NewFeature/index.tsx
touch src/components/organisms/NewFeature/NewFeature.test.tsx
```

3. Add route (if needed):

```tsx
// src/core/routes/Routes.tsx
import NewFeature from '@/components/organisms/NewFeature'

// Add to routes array
{
  path: '/new-feature',
  element: <NewFeature />
}
```

### Styling Components

We use Tailwind CSS with custom configurations:

```tsx
// Example component with Tailwind
const Button = ({ children }) => <button className='px-4 py-2 bg-primary hover:bg-primary-dark rounded-md'>{children}</button>;
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**

```bash
# Clear dependencies and cache
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf .vite
npm install
```

2. **Stale Development Server**

```bash
# Reset development server
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf .vite
npm install
npm run dev
```
